Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm <!-- (real name redacted for personal safety... libera me from Texas) -->Cappiebara, a developer who likes to make people's jobs easier. I currently 
work as the Accessibility Team Lead for the **Center for Instructional Development and Technology** at SOSU, where I also 
attend as a student. The software I'm most proud of is **CCAU** (pronounced as "cow"), a suite of userscripts which help to 
automate some of the more tedious/repetitive aspects of course copies in the Canvas learning management system.

I also created **srt2** and **uxmlwriter**, which help over 3,500 people make their content more accessible when using the 
SubRip (SRT) subtitle format to caption videos.
